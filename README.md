# CarBall

A game inspired by Rocket League and built for the web.

End goal: An online, 3D multiplayer game with gameplay similar to Rocket League.

High-level goals:

1. A single-player version of the game with no menu or customization
2. Adding local multiplayer
3. Adding a menu and online multiplayer
4. Adding more customization options
5. ??? (if I get this far, think of something else to do)

Steps for single player portion:

1. Put a car on the ground.
2. Make that car drivable (with realistic physics) using the keyboard and/or game controller.
3. Allow the car to jump and boost.
4. Allow the car to flip (and flip-cancel).
5. Add a ball that can be moved when hit by the car.
6. Add a goal where the ball can be scored.
7. Allow the car to air roll.
8. Turn the ground into a field with walls and a ceiling.
